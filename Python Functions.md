# Functions in Python
- There are three ways to manupulate and use variables.
    - Operators (e.g. `5 + 7`)
    - Functions (e.g. `len("Python")`)
    - Methods (e.g. `"Python".islower()`)
        - They may not have function arguments.
        ```python
        "Python".tolower()
        ```
        - They may have function arguments.
        ```python
        "One fish. Two fish.".count("fish")
        ```
